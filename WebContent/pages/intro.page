Welcome to my page!  This page is powered by <a href="https://github.com/cgtboy1988/EZPage">EZPage</a>,
which is a limited scope, lightweight, file system based web framework that runs on Tomcat+JSP that I
wrote when told I had to have a personal website.  The photos cycling in the background are taken
by&mdash;or, occasionally, around&mdash;me, at sites around the globe.
</p>
<p>
Because this is supposed to be a personal/professional website&mdash;which, apparently,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clark-taylor-7a23b79a/">LinkedIn</a> has not yet made
obsolete&mdash;here are a few basics:
<ul>
<li>I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.cs.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona Department of Computer Science</a>, where I work primarily with my faculty advisor <a href="http://collberg.cs.arizona.edu/">Christian Collberg</a></li>
<li>I also work on computer security and outreach at <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a></li>
<li>In 2016, I earned a JD from the <a href="https://law.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona James E. Rogers Law School</a></li>
<li>In 2012, I earned a BS in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.csuchico.edu/csci/">California State University, Chico</a></li>
<li>I am originally from Sacramento, CA, and currently reside in Tucson, AZ</li>
</ul>
