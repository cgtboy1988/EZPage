Despite having a comfortable desk to work on various digital and legal projects, I do engage in quite
a few other activities.  When not at said comfortable desk, I might be traveling, hiking, biking, working with
metal and wood, gardening, playing music&mdash;primarily the bass guitar, and taking photos along the
way.
