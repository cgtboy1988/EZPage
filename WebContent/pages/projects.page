Ongoing Projects
<p>
I am currently actively working on several projects at both the University of Arizona and Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory.  These include:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="highlighted">RevEngE</h3>
<span class="highlighted">University of Arizona</span>
<p>
<a href="http://revenge.cs.arizona.edu">The Reverse Engineering Engine</a> (RevEngE) is a web application designed to empirically study the strength
and strategies to defeat code obfuscation.  RevEngE also includes educational aspects, having the capability
to generate reverse engineering problems for training and classroom use.

<h3 class="highlighted">Catalyst Security Challenge</h3>
<span class="highlighted">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</span>
<p>
The Catalyst Security Challenge Framework (see associated publication <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/ase17/workshop-program/presentation/taylor">here</a>)
is an in-development system designed to extensibly host many different types of computer science challenges,
with an emphasis on security.  One component, the Catalyst Data Collection Engine&mdash;which is an expansion of
the data collection engine originally implemented for RevEngE&mdash;is operational and can
be found <a href="http://revenge.cs.arizona.edu/DataCollectorServer/openDataCollection/index.jsp">here</a>.
This particular component offers a way to monitor the human-device interaction of end users, particularly
as they complete tasks, in order to study that interaction.
</p>

<h3 class="highlighted">Cyber Fire</h3>
<span class="highlighted">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory</span>
<p>
<a href="https://cyberfire.lanl.gov">Cyber Fire</a> is a Los Alamos developed CTF competition which has
expanded into a joint effort between Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, other Department of Energy entities,
and industry partners.  The joint team advances the CTF infrastructure components and builds new
challenge content. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="highlighted">Journal of Emerging Technology</h3>
<span class="highlighted">University of Arizona</span>
<p>
<a href="https://ljet.arizona.edu">The University of Arizona Law Journal of Emerging Technology</a> (JET
or LJET) is a new journal at the James E. Rogers College of Law.  I served as founding editor-in-chief
and currently serve as the chief systems manager.  The journal is very much a work-in-progress, as is its
publication software.
